## Introduction

The aim of these labs is to reinforce the concepts that we discuss in each module's videos. These labs will revolve around the use case of food recipes, and together, we will walk through the process that data scientists usually follow when trying to solve a problem. Let's get started!

In this lab, we will start learning about the data science methodology, and focus on the **Business Understanding** and the **Analytic Approach** stages.

#### Why is the business understanding stage important?

ANSWER: It helps *clarify* the *goal* of the entity asking the question.

#### Looking at this diagram, we immediately spot two outstanding features of the data science methodology.

#### What are they?

ANSWERS: 
1. The flowchart is highly iterative.
2. The flowchart never ends. 

#### Now let's illustrate the data science methodology with a case study.

Say, we are interested in automating the process of figuring out the cuisine of a given dish or recipe. Let's apply the business understanding stage to this problem.

#### Q. Can we predict the cuisine of a given dish using the name of the dish only?

ANSWER: No

#### Q. For example, the following dish names were taken from the menu of a local restaurant in Toronto, Ontario in Canada. 

#### 1. Beast
#### 2. 2 PM
#### 3. 4 Minute

#### Are you able to tell the cuisine of these dishes?

ANSWER: The cuisine is <strong>Japanese</strong>. Here are links to the images of the dishes:
