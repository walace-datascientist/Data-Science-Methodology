## Introduction

The aim of these labs is to reinforce the concepts that we discuss in each module's videos. These labs will revolve around the use case of food recipes, and together, we will walk through the process that data scientists usually follow when trying to solve a problem. Let's get started!

In this lab, we will start learning about the data science methodology, and focus on the **Business Understanding** and the **Analytic Approach** stages.

# Business Understanding <a id="0"></a>

This is the **Data Science Methodology**, a flowchart that begins with business understanding.

#### Why is the business understanding stage important?

ANSWER: It helps *clarify* the *goal* of the entity asking the question.

#### Looking at this diagram, we immediately spot two outstanding features of the data science methodology.

#### What are they?

ANSWERS: 
1. The flowchart is highly iterative.
2. The flowchart never ends. 

#### Now let's illustrate the data science methodology with a case study.

Say, we are interested in automating the process of figuring out the cuisine of a given dish or recipe. Let's apply the business understanding stage to this problem.

#### Q. Can we predict the cuisine of a given dish using the name of the dish only?

ANSWER: No

#### Q. For example, the following dish names were taken from the menu of a local restaurant in Toronto, Ontario in Canada. 

#### 1. Beast
#### 2. 2 PM
#### 3. 4 Minute

#### Are you able to tell the cuisine of these dishes?

ANSWER: The cuisine is <strong>Japanese</strong>. Here are links to the images of the dishes:

#### Q. What about by appearance only? Yes or No.

ANSWER: No, especially when it comes to countries in close geographical proximity such as Scandinavian countries, or Asian countries.

At this point, we realize that automating the process of determining the cuisine of a given dish is not a straightforward problem as we need to come up with a way that is very robust to the many cuisines and their variations.

#### Q. What about determining the cuisine of a dish based on its ingredients?

ANSWER: Potentially yes, as there are specific ingredients unique to each cuisine.

As you guessed, yes determining the cuisine of a given dish based on its ingredients seems like a viable solution as some ingredients are unique to cuisines. For example:

* When we talk about **American** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind (or at least to my mind =D) is beef or turkey.

* When we talk about **British** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is haddock or mint sauce.

* When we talk about **Canadian** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is bacon or poutine.

* When we talk about **French** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is bread or butter.

* When we talk about **Italian** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is tomato or ricotta.

* When we talk about **Japanese** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is seaweed or soy sauce.

* When we talk about **Chinese** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is ginger or garlic.

* When we talk about **indian** cuisines, the first ingredient that comes to one's mind is masala or chillis.
