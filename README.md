# Data Science `Methodology` Repository

## Introduction
The aim of this repository is discuss the proposal of a Data Science Methodogy developed by Doctor John B. Rollins consisting of a 10-stage data science methodology that spans technologies and approaches to form an iterative process for using data to uncover insights
which you can a find a complete description [`here`][methodology_link].

For more information about this methodology, the following course on  [`Coursera`][course_link] is a great start.

## Contributing guidelines

We’d love for you to help us improve this project. To help us keep this collection
high quality, we request that contributions adhere to the following guidelines.

- **Provide a link to the application or project’s homepage**. Unless it’s
  extremely popular, there’s a chance the maintainers don’t know about or use
  the language, framework, editor, app, or project your change applies to.

- **Provide links to documentation** supporting the change you’re making.
  Current, canonical documentation mentioning the files being ignored is best.
  If documentation isn’t available to support your change, do the best you can
  to explain what the files being ignored are for.

- **Explain why you’re making a change**. Even if it seems self-evident, please
  take a sentence or two to tell us why your change or addition should happen.
  It’s especially helpful to articulate why this change applies to *everyone*
  who works with the applicable technology, rather than just you or your team.

- **Please consider the scope of your change**. If your change is specific to a
  certain language or framework, then make sure the change is made to the
  template for that language or framework, rather than to the template for an
  editor, tool, or operating system.

- **Please only modify *one template* per pull request**. This helps keep pull
  requests and feedback focused on a specific project or technology.

In general, the more you can do to help us understand the change you’re making,
the more likely we’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.
